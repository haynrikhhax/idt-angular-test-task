Couple of notes about the task, if I was able to use other libs and packages I would use i18n and angulars localize package in order to handle the localization, besides that I would use tailwind for more consice and better css, I would also take into account some ui libraries that have components such as inputs, buttones, etc... for easier and better looking UI.
